# py_SequelizeGen
This script generates Sequelize Models based on MySQL database.

Basically you just need to change those parameters and run it, then inside `models` folder you should see your Sequelize models generated as it is in your schema.

```
MYSQL_HOST = 'localhost'
MYSQL_USER = 'user'
MYSQL_PASSWORD = 'pass'
MYSQL_DB = 'db'
```
